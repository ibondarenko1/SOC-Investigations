### Artifacts / IOCs

Sender: update@windows-update.site  
Recipient: dylan@letsdefend.io  
Subject: “Upgrade your system to Windows 11 Pro for FREE”  
URL: https://windows-update.site/  
Source IP: 132.232.40.201  
Destination IP: 172.16.17.216 (Dylan workstation)  
Malware: Lumma Stealer (DLL side-loading technique)  
MITRE ATT&CK: T1071 (Application Layer Protocol), T1574.002 (DLL Side-Loading)


### Technical analysis

The phishing email impersonated Microsoft and tricked the user into clicking a link promising a free Windows 11 upgrade. 
The URL redirected to a malicious site hosting a “Click Fix” script that downloaded and side-loaded a Lumma Stealer DLL. 
Execution was confirmed through PowerShell and cmd.exe activity on the host, followed by outbound connections to 132.232.40.201. 
Logs also showed data exfiltration attempts typical for Lumma Stealer, which targets browser credentials and cryptocurrency wallets. 
The incident was confirmed as a True Positive.


### Actions taken / Mitigation

1. Quarantined the affected workstation (Dylan – 172.16.17.216) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration.  
2. Blocked the malicious domain https://windows-update.site/ and related IP 132.232.40.201 on the firewall and secure web gateway.  
3. Conducted a full antivirus and EDR scan to remove Lumma Stealer and any persistence mechanisms.  
4. Reviewed email gateway logs to confirm no additional users received the same phishing email.  
5. Forced password reset for the affected user (Dylan) and cleared browser-saved credentials.  
6. Implemented stricter email filtering rules to detect spoofed Microsoft domains.  
7. Added Lumma Stealer indicators (IOCs) to threat intelligence feeds for future detection.  
8. Notified IT and management teams about the incident and recommended user awareness training to prevent similar attacks.


### Recommendations / Next steps

1. Conduct phishing awareness training for all employees, focusing on identifying fake Microsoft upgrade emails.  
2. Enable advanced threat protection (ATP) and sandboxing on the email gateway to automatically detonate and analyze suspicious links.  
3. Implement DNS filtering and reputation-based URL blocking to prevent user access to newly registered or low-reputation domains.  
4. Deploy Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) policies to monitor for DLL side-loading and PowerShell abuse.  
5. Regularly update and patch Windows systems to mitigate exploitation of outdated components used by malware loaders.  
6. Integrate Lumma Stealer IOCs into SIEM correlation rules for early detection in future incidents.  
7. Perform periodic security audits to ensure containment and verify that no persistence or backdoor remains.  
8. Review current incident response playbooks and improve escalation procedures for phishing-related malware infections.
